## 🌐 Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

The platform utilizes a modern, automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline powered by **Vercel** and connected directly to the project's GitHub repository.

### How the Pipeline Works:
1. **GitHub Integration**: The repository's primary branch (`main`) is monitored by Vercel webhooks.
2. **Automated Trigger**: Any new code changes pushed to the `main` branch immediately trigger an isolated containerized build process in the cloud.
3. **Production Optimization**: 
   - **Static Page Generation**: Pages are pre-rendered into highly optimized static HTML, CSS, and JS during the build phase.
   - **Compiling**: The application uses Turbo-compiling to minimize bundle size, bundle code components, compress CSS layout variables, and optimize asset paths.
   - **Validation**: Next.js and TypeScript configurations are strictly verified to ensure zero build errors before going live.
4. **Instant Edge Propagation**: Once compile checks pass, Vercel deploys the build artifacts onto their global Edge Network for fast page loads worldwide.

### Live Environment:
* **Production URL**: [https://shipping.ragasgroups.com/](https://shipping.ragasgroups.com/)
* **Custom Domain Management**: The custom DNS records are pointed directly to Vercel's global router, handling SSL certificate renewals automatically.

Any updates made to this codebase will reflect live automatically within minutes of pushing.
